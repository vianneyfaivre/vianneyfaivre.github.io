Liferay Service-Builder mechanism generates a lot of code, itâ€™s very easy to use and it lets you use the Liferay Service API.

If you want to use external classes in your service impl classes you must use a special annotation : <strong>@BeanReference </strong>(from the package com.liferay.portal.kernel.bean)

Using this annotation you can inject your classes into your service and then use it without having any exceptions on class loading context.

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
<li>Declare the bean you want to inject in the spring configuration file of your portlet</li>

{% highlight xml %}
<bean id="com.test.service.MyService" class="com.test.service.impl.MyServiceImpl" />
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Make a reference to this bean in your service impl class</li>

{% highlight java %}
@BeanReference(type = MyService.class)
private MyService myService;
{% endhighlight %}

</ol>

Et voila! Now you can use the service "myService" in your service impl methods :)

NB : if you want to understand how the injection is done, have a look at this class : BeanReferenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor
